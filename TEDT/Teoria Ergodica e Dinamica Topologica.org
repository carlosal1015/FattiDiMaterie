* Definizioni
  - (*Deterministic Dynamical system*, from an article of Smale, '67)  A dynsys is the datum of:
    * $G$ a semi-group (which gives the notion of time, e.g. $\bbN, \bbZ, \bbR$)
    * $X$ is a phase space, that can be:
      - A locally compact metric space $\rar$ topological dynamics
      - A Measure Space $(X, \cA, \mu)$ s.t. $\mu(X) = 1$ (compactness equation)

    The dynsys is specified by an action of $G$ on $X$: $\Phi: G \times X \rar X$ defined by $\Phi(g, x) = \phi_g (x)$ satisfying:
    1. $\phi_e(x) = x$
    2. $\phi_{g + h}(x) = \phi_g \circ \phi_h (x)$
    3. $\forall g : \phi_g \in \End(X)$

    Moreover:
    * If $X$ is a metric space, then $\phi_g$ is assumed to be continuous
    * If $X$ is a measure space, we ask that $\forall A \in \cA : \mu(\phi_g^{-1}(A)) = \mu(A)$
  
    *Remark*: Every ODE or PDE of evolution time with global existance is a dynamical system.

    *Remark*: Every continuous dynsys becomes a discrete dynsys ($G = \bbZ$) by stroboscopic observation.
    i.e. Fix $\tau > 0$ and consider $(\phi_{n\tau})_{n \in \bbZ}$. The choice of $\tau$, concerning the applications, is the busillis.
  - (*Conjugate dynsys*) Two $G$-actions on $X$: $(\phi, \psi)$ are conjugated iff there $\exists \xi \in \Aut(X)$ s.t. the following diagram commutes
    \begin{diagram}
    X & \rTo^{\psi_g} & X \\
    \dTo^{\xi} & & \dTo_{\xi} \\
    X & \rTo^{\phi_g} & X \\
    \end{diagram}
    i.e. the two systems have the same orbit under a fixed change of coordinate.
    It is a natural notion for discdynsys but it is too much for contdynsys, because I'm also asking that the orbits have the same speed.
  - (*Topologically Conjugate Homeo*)
    Let $f, g: X \rar X$ be two homeomorphisms, and $X$ a compact metric space.
   
    We say that $f$ and $g$ are *topologically conjugate* if there $\exists h: X \rar X$ homeomorphism such that $f \circ h = h \circ g$.
    In such case of course we also have $f^n \circ h = h \circ g^n$.
  - (*Structurally stable systems*) $X$ $\cC^r$ compact manifold with $r \ge 0$.
    Denote by $\cG^r$ the $\cC^r$ dynamical discrete system on $X$: $\cG^r = \Diff^r(X)$, which is a topological space with the local distance given by the sup of the difference of the sum of the derivatives in a ball.
    
    Theorem: $\cG^r$ is a banach manifold.
  - (*Structurally stable dynamics*) The set $SS(X)$ of structurally stable dynamical systems is $\lrg{ f \in \cG \mid \exists W \text{ open neigh. of } f s.t. \forall g \in W \implies g \sim_\text{top} f }$.
    The complement of the SS points of $\cG$ is called the bifurcation set (which is closed).
  - (*Wandering Point*) $x \in X$ is wandering iff $\exists U$ neigh. of $x$ s.t. $\lrt{\cup_{n \neq 0\in \bbZ} f^n(U)} \cap U = \empty$.

    $\Omega(f) = \lrg{x \in X \mid x \text{ not wandering }}$.

    Definition of $\alpha$ and $\omega$ limits of $x$:
    - $\alpha(x)$ is the set of all acculumations points of the orbit of x _in the past_
    - $\omega(x)$ is the set of all accumulations points of the orbit of x _in the future_
      
      that is $y \in \omega(x)$ iff $\exists n_k \rar \infty$ s.t. $x_{n_k} \rar y$.

    Two alternative definitions are:
    $$ 
       \alpha(x) = \cap_{n < 0} \bar{\cup_{m \le n} f^m(x)} \hskip 1.5em
       \omega(x) = \cap_{n > 0} \bar{\cup_{m \ge n} f^m(x)}
    $$
  - (*Recurrent points*) A point $x$ is (positively / negatively) recurrent iff $x \in \omega(x)$ / $x \in \alpha(x)$.
    And it's said to be recurrent if $x \in \alpha(x) \cap \omega(x)$ \sse x \in \Omega(f)$.

    We define the reccurent point of $A$ by $A_\text{rec} = \lrg{x \in A \mid f^n(x) \in A \text{ for } \infty \text{ many } n \in \bbN}$.
  - (*Devaney chaos*) A system $(X, d, f)$ is chaotic /Ã  la Devaney/ iff it is toptrans and the set of periodic points $\Per(f)$ is dense.
  - (*SDOIC - Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions*) $(X, d, f)$ is SDOIC at a point $x_0 \in X$ iff there $\exists \varepsilon > 0$ $\exists U$ nghb. of $x_0$ st. $\forall y_0 \in U$ there $\exists n \ge 0$ : $d(f^n(x_0), f^n(y_0)) > \varepsilon$.
    
    *Remarks*: 
    - Isometries are never SDOIC
    - Uniformly expanding maps must be SDOIC
  - (*Lyapounov Stability*) $(X, d, f)$ is lyapounov stable at $x_0$ iff $\forall \varepsilon > 0$ there $\exists U$ nhbg of $x_0$ s.t. $\forall y_0 \in U$ $\forall n \ge 0$ : $d(f^n(x_0), f^n(y_0)) < \varepsilon$.
  - (*Ergodicity*) $(X, \cA, \mu, f)$ a meas discdynsys and $\mu(f^{-1}(A)) = \mu(A) \quad \forall A \in \cA$.
    
    /Idea/: We want to interpret $\mu$ as a probability "naturally generated from the dynamics", i.e. what is its relation to the statistics of the orbits?
    
    We are asking if it holds the law of large numbers:
    $$\bbE[\phi] \stackrel{?}{=} \lim_{T \rar \infty} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{j = 0}^{T - 1} \phi \circ f^j(x)$$
    If the equality holds we call such system *ergodic*. Note that $\phi \circ f^j(x) = \phi(x_j)$.
    
    1. Is there a statistics associated to orbits of $f$? (See Birkoff theorem)
    2. Are the empirical frequencies (computed by means of the orbit) converging to the apriori probability of $\mu$? (Content of Ergodicity)
       
    ------
    Let $A \in \cA, x_0 \in X, T > 0$. We define:
    - "number of visits of the orbit of length $T$ of $x_0$ to $A$": $\cN(A, x_0, T) = \sum_{j = 0}^{T - 1} \chi_A (f^j(x_0))$.
    - "average frequency of visits of ...": $\nu(A, x_0, T) = \cN(A, x_0, T) \cdot \frac1T$.
    - "upper and lower frequencies of visits to the orbit of $x_0$ to $A$": $\bar{\nu}(A, x_0) = \limsup_{T \rar \infty} \nu(A, x_0, T)$ and $\underline{\nu}{A, x_0) = \liminf_{T \rar \infty} \nu(A, x_0, T)$.
      
    If $\underline{\nu}(A, x_0) = \bar\nu(A, x_0)$ we call it the frequency of visits and denote it by $\nu(A, x_0)$.

    *Birkoff sum*: Given an observable $\phi: X \rar \bbR$ we define the "Birkoff sum" of $\phi$ along a segment of orbit of $x_0$ of length $T$ by $(\cS_T \phi)(x_0) = \sum_{j=0}^{T-1} \phi(x_j)$.
    
    The "time average of $\phi$ ..." is $\frac1T (\cS_T \phi)(x_0)$ and if $\lim_{T \rar \infty} \frac1T (\cS_T \phi)(x_0)$ exists then we call it $\lra{\phi}(x_0)$ and we have $\lra\phi \circ f = \lra\phi$.
    - (*Birkoff theorem*) Let $(X, \cA, \mu, f)$ be a measurable dynsys:
      1. $\forall A \in \cA$ and $\mu$-a.e. $x_0 \in X$ we have $\nu(A, x_0)$ exists
      2. $\forall \phi \in \cL^1$ and $\mu$-a.e. $x_0 \in X$ the time average $\lra\phi$ exists

    - (*Ergodicity*) A MDS is *ergodic* iff $\forall A \in \cA$, $\mu$-a.e. $x_0 \in X$ : $\nu(A, x_0) = \mu(A)$.

      TFAE:
      1. The dynsys is *ergodic* and *topologically transitive*
      2. (*Metrical indecomposability*) $\forall A \in \cA$, $A$ is $f$-invariant $\implies$ $\mu(A) = 0$ or $\mu(A) = 1$
      3. $\forall \phi$ observable, $\phi$ is a first integral, i.e. $\exists c \in \bbR$ s.t. $\phi = c$ $\mu$-a.e.
      4. $\forall \phi \in \cL^1$ observable and $\mu$-a.e. $x_0 \in X$ we have $\lra\phi = \bbE_\mu[\phi] = \lim_{T \rar \infty} \frac1T \sum_{j = 0}^{T - 1} \phi \circ f^j == \int_X \phi \de\mu$.
      5. $\forall A, B \in \cA$: $\lim_{n \rar \infty} \frac1n \sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} \mu(f^{-j}(A) \cap B) = \mu(A) \mu(B)$
   - (*Strongly mixing*) We say a MDS is strongly mixing iff $\forall A, B \in \cA$ we have $\lim_{n \rar \infty} \mu(f^{-n}(A) \cap B) = \mu(A) \mu(B)$.
     
     This *implies ergodicity*. The converse does not hold.
   - (*Lyapounov exponent for map of intervals preserving $\mu$*): $\lambda = \int_I \ln\abs{f'(x)} \de\mu(x)$, that exists because $\frac1n \sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} \ln\abs{f'(x_j)}$ converges $\mu$-a.e.
   - (*Hahn decomposition of a measure*) Let $(X, \cA, \mu)$ and $\mu$ a signed measure.
     Then there $\exists P, N \in \cA$ s.t.:
     1. $P \cap N = \emptyset$ and $P \cup N = X$
     2. $\forall E \subseteq P$ and $E \in \cA$ we have $\mu(E) \ge 0$
     3. $\forall E \subseteq N$ and $E \in \cA$ we have $\mu(E) \le 0$

     Moreover, $P$ and $N$ are uniquely determined, except for a set of null measure.
     We will denote $\mu^+(E) = \mu(E \cap P)$ and $\mu^-(E) = \mu(E \cap N)$.
   - (*Extreme points of a convex subset of tvs*) Let $S \subseteq X$ and $S$ convex.
     Then $x_0 \in S$ is an extremal point of $S$ if $x_0 \notin$ any open segment joining two points of $S$.
   
     *Krein-Milman Theorem*: Let $X$ be a lctvs and $S \subseteq X$ a convex.
     Then $S$ is the /closed convex hull/ of its extremal points.
   - (*Unique ergodicity*) iff $\cM_f(X) = \lrg\mu$.
   - (*Support of a measure*) $\supp \mu = \bar\lrg{x \in X \mid \forall U \subseteq X \text{ open }, x \in U \implies \mu(U) > 0}$
   - (*1-coboundaries*) Let $X4 be a compact metric space and $f: X \rar X$ an homeomorphism.
     A continuous observable $\phi \in \cC^0(X, \bbR)$ is a 1-coboundary iff $\exists \psi \in \cC(X, \bbR)$ s.t.
     $$\phi = \psi\circ f - \psi = \de_f \psi$$

     We can then show that $\cM_f^\text{sign}(X) \simeq \de_f\cC(X, \bbR)^\top = \frac{\cC(X, \bbR)}{\bar{\de_f \cC(X, \bbR)}}$.

     From that follows that *corollary*: $f$ is uniquely ergodic iff $\bar{\de_f \cC(X, \bbR)}$ has codimension $1$ in $\cC(X, \bbR)$.

     *Exercise*: If $\phi$ is a coboundary then $\frac1n \sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} \phi \circ f^j \stackrel{\rar}{\rar} 0$.
* Properties of maps
  - (*Topological transitivity*) A dynsys is *topologically transitive* iff $\exists x \in X$ s.t. $\bar{\cO_f(x)} = X$.

    Moreover TFAE:
    1. $f$ is topologically transitive
    2. $U \subseteq X$ open and $f$-invariant (i.e. $U = f(U) = f^{-1}(U)) $\implies U = \emptyset$ or $\bar{U} = X$.
    3. If $U$ and $V$ are open and non-empty then there $\exists n \in \bbN$ s.t. $f^n(U) \cap V \neq \emptyset$
    4. $\lrg{x \in X \mid \bar{\cO_f(x)} = X}$ is a dense $G_\delta$.
  - (*Genericity*) The word "generic" in topological dynamic means that the behaviour happens in a dense $G_\delta$.
  - (*Minimality*) A dynsys is *minimal* iff $\forall x \in X$ : $\bar{\cO_f(x)} = X$.
* Categories
  - (*Suspension*) Given a discdynsys on $X$ represented by the map $f: X \rar X$ we can obtain a contdynsys on $Y$ that is "naturally associated" with the initial one.
    We take $Y = X \times \frac{[0, 1]}{(x, 1) \sim (f(x), 0)}$ and the action is $\frac{\partial}{\partial s}$, i.e. a traslation on the second coordinate. 

    If $X$ is a variety and $f \in \Diff(X)$, then $Y$ is regular.
  - (*Suspension under a roof*) /return time/
    ... and if there is a section s.t. the return time is constant we have a cohomological equation.
  - (*PoincarÃ© section*) It is in a certain sense, the inverse operation of suspension:
  
    We look at an hypersurface $\Sigma$, trasversal to the field of $Y$, and define the map "first comeback on $\Sigma$".
    Note that taking $\Sigma = X$ in the suspension we get to the original discdynsys.
  - (*Factors of maps*) Suppose we have the following diagram:
    \begin{diagram}
    Y & \rTo^{g} & Y \\
    \dTo^{\pi} & & \dTo_{\pi} \\
    X & \rTo^{f} & X \\
    \end{diagram}
    then we say that *f is a factor of g* and that *g extends f*.
  - (*Observables*) An observable is just a function $\phi: X \rar \bbC$ in the same "category" of your phase space X.
    
    Precisely, for topdyn we ask that $\phi \in \cC^0(X, \bbC)$ and for measdyn we ask that $\phi: X \rar \bbC$ be measurable or $\cL^1(X, \cA, \mu)$

    *First integral*: is an observable which is constant along orbits and globally non-constant
  - (*Skew-product*) Given a dynsys $f: X \rar X$ we extend it using $\phi: X \rar \bbR$:
    \begin{diagram}
    X \times \bbR & \rTo^{F} & X \times \bbR \\
    \dTo^{\pi_1} & & \dTo_{\pi_1} \\
    X & \rTo^{f} & X \\
    \end{diagram}
    where $F(x, u) = (f(x), u + \phi(x))$.
  - (*Transfer operator*) Let $T: I \rar I$ be a non-singular continuous map (i.e., $\mu(A) = 0 \implies \mu(T(A)) = 0$).
    We define the transfer operator as $P_T: \cL^1 \rar \cL^1$ s.t. $\int_A P_T f\de m = \int_{T^{-1}A} f \de m$ for every $A$ measurable.

    /Properties/:
    1. $P_T$ is linear
    2. $P_T$ is positive (i.e. $f \ge 0 \implies P_T f \ge 0$)
    3. Normalization preserving: $\int_I P_T f \de\mu = \int_I f \de m$
    4. is a contraction wrt. $\cL^1$: $\norm{P_T f^+}_1 \le \norm{f}_1$

    *Theorem*: Transfer fix-point define $T$-invariant measures: $P_T f^* = f^*$ and $T$ non-singular iff $\mu(A) = \int_A f^* \de m$ is $T$-invariant
    
    *Theorem*: $T$ non singular, $\mu$ invariant. Then $T$ is ergodic iff $\frac1n \sum_{n = 1}^\infty P_T^n f \rhu^{\cL^1} \mathbb{1}$ for every $f \neq 0$.
* Examples of dynsys
  - (*Irrational rotations of the torus*) $R_\alpha: \bbT^1 \rar \bbT^1 \simeq \bbR/\bbZ$ defined by $R_\alpha(x) = x + \alpha$ for $\alpha \in \bbR \setminus \bbQ$ is *minimal*.
    
    Let now $X = \bbT^n = \bbR^n / \bbZ^n$ for $n \ge 2$ and $R_\alpha: X \rar X$ with $x \mapsto x + \alpha$ where
    $\alpha \in \bbR^n$ must satisfy $k \cdot \alpha + p \neq 0$ $\quad \forall k \in \bbZ^n \setminus \lrg{0}, p \in \bbZ$.
    This is the right condition instead of irrationality in the multidimensional case to be minimal.

    /Properties/: Irrational rotations are *ergodic*.
    *Suspension*: The suspension of the rotation $R_\alpha$ on the unit circle is a linear flow on the torus given by $\dot{x_1} = \omega_1$ and $\dot{x_2} = \omega_2$ where $\alpha = \frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}$.
  - (*Doubling map. $x \mapsto 2x (\mod 1)$*) is *topologically transitive* but *not minimal*, because zero is a fix point.
    If we write the numbers in binary expansion this system is just the shift of the digit string $\lrg{0, 2}^\bbN$.
    
    Where the shift $\sigma: \lrg{0,1}^\bbN \rar \lrg{0,1}^\bbN$ is defined as: let $s = (s_j)_{j \in \bbN}$ where $s_j \in \lrg{0,1}$ is an element.
    Then the left shift is $(\sigma(s))_j = s_{j+1}$ and the distance between two points is defined as $d(s, t) = 2^{- \min_j \lrg{ s_j \neq t_j }}$.

    A dense point is the concatenation of all possible prefixes: $s = 0 \, 1 \, 00 \, 01 \, 10 \, 11 \, 000 \, \ldots$.
    It is dense because if we want to get near $x_1$ we can search the first digits of the expansion of $x_1$ and then iterate until they are the first digits of $f^n(x_0)$.

    /Properties/: The doubling map is *ergodic*.
  - (*Tent map*) Defined by
    $$F(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} 2x & x \in [0, \frac{1}{2}] \\ 2 - 2x & x \in [\frac{1}{2}, 1] \\ \end{array} \right.$$
    The lebesgue measure is $F$-invariant.

    /Properties/: It is *ergodic*, *mixing* and *positively entropic*.
  - (*Ulam-Von Neumann map*) Defined by $x \mapsto 4 x (1-x)$. An invariant measure for it is $\de\mu(x) = \frac{\de x}{\pi \sqrt{x (1-x)}}$.

    Conjugated to the Tent Map by a change of variables: $y = \sin^2 \lrt{\frac{\pi x}{2}}$.
  
    In general the family of $x \mapsto \lambda x (1-x)$ where $x \in [0, 1], \lambda \in [0, 4]$ is called the logistic family.
    For low values of $\lambda$ we have an attractive fix point at the origin.
    For high values of lambda the system exibits a chaotic behaviour.
  - (*Cauchy distribution*) $f: \bbR \rar \bbR$ defined by $f(x) = \frac12 \lrt{x - \frac1x}$.
    It preserves $\de\mu(x) = \frac{\de x}{\pi (1 + x^2)}$, it is a distribution that has no moments.
  - (*Hyperbolic automorphisms of the torus are ergodic*) An automorphisms $A$ is hyberbolic when its spectrum $\sigma(A)$ is disjoint from the unit circle iff $\abs{\Tr(A)} > 2$.
    Let $A = \matr{a}{b}{c}{d}$ and let $f_A: \bbT^2 \rar \bbT^2$ induced by $A$ as $f_A \vect{x_1}{x_2} = \vect{a x_1 + b x_2}{c x_1 + d x_2}$.
    Let $\phi: \bbT^2 \rar \bbC$ and from $\phi \circ f_A = \phi$ we get that if $\phi \in \cL^2$ we have $\hat\phi (k) = \hat\phi(\lrt{A^\dagger}^{-1} k) \quad \forall k \in \bbZ^2$
  - (*Hamiltonian ODE*) $H: \bbR^{2n} \rar \bbR$ the map $H(\rab p, \rab q)$ and consider the system given by
    $$\system{\dot p_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} \\ \dot q_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}}$$
    
    In Hamiltonian system one wants to preserve the special form of the equation with transformations.

    *CCI - Completely Canonically Integrable systems*: A system is CCI iff there $\exists$ canonical variables ACTION ($J \in B_1 \subseteq \bbR^n$) and ANGLE ($\chi \in \bbT^n$) such that the new Hamiltonian only depends on the actions.
    For a CCI we have that all $J$ are first integrals and $\chi_k(t) = \omega_k(t) + \chi_k(0)$ where $\omega_k(t) = \partial{H}{j_k}(j)$.

    In dimension $n = 1$ all Hamiltonian systems are CCI.

    In dimension $n = 2$ the value of the Hamiltonian is preserved, and we can foliate the space by its "energy".
* Spiegazioni
  - (*Measurable dynamics: obstructions to measure preserving*)
    1. Lack of compactness (e.g. $X = \bbR, f(x) = x + 1$)
    2. Discontinuity (e.g. $X = [0, 1]$, $f(x) = 0 \text{ if } x = 1$ and $f(x) = x \text{ if } x \neq 1$, the fixed point is not there)
  - (*Measurable dynamics: probabilistic pov*) $(X, \cA, mu, f)$:
    - $X$ is the "samples space"
    - $\cA$ is a "collection of events"
    - $\mu$ is "the probability" ($\mu(A) = \bbP(x \in A)$)
    - Observables in dynamics $\leftrightarrow$ "Random variables"
    - $\phi_n = \phi \circ f^n$ is the analogue of a "stochastic process"
  - (*Pseudo-Random Generators*) We want to generate numbers according to the Cauchy distribution $\de\mu(x) = \frac{\de}{\pi (1 + x^2)}$, that we know is associated (is an invariant measure to the ergodic dynsys) $f(x) = \frac12 \lrt{x - \frac1x}$ on $\bbR$.
    By conjugacy ($z = \frac{x - i}{x + i}$) we get the doubling map on the circle: $T(\theta) = 2 \theta (\mod 1)$.

    Not, to get an almost-Gaussian generator, we can do a change of variables $h(x) = \log \frac{x}{1 - x}$ and obtain something similar to a Gaussian.

* Fatterelli e Teoremi
  - (*Multipliers*) For a fix point $x_0 \in X$ his multiplier is defined as the diffeomorphism derivative at the point $f'(x_0)$.
    If the orbit of $x_0$ is periodic of period $p$, then the multiplier is the product $\prod_{i=0}^{p-1} f'(x_i)$.
  - (*Top conj $\implies$ same multipliers*) If $f, g, h \in \cC^1$ and we have a fixed point $x_0 \in X$ (i.e. $gx_0 = x_0$, so also $f(h x_0) = h x_0$) then we have $f = h \circ g \circ h^{-1}$ and, denoted by $\bar{x_0} = h(x_0)$ we have that $f'(\bar{x_0}) = g'(\bar{x_0}) = \lambda$ i.e. the point multiplier is the same.
  - (*Theorem*) If $f$ is Devaney-chaotic on $X$ and $X$ has no isolated points then $f$ has SDOIC.
  - (*Krylov-Bogolyubov*) If $X$ is a complete metric space and $f \in \cC^0(X)$, then there $\exists \mu$ an $f$-invariant probability measure defined on borelians

    * Let now be $\cM(X)$ the space of probability measures on $X$ endowed with the weak${}^*$ topology, i.e. $\mu_n \rar \mu$ iff $\forall \phi \in \cC(X, \bbR)$ we have $\int_X \phi \de \mu_n \rar \int_X \phi \de \mu$. Then $\cM(X)$ is compact.
    * *Riesz representation theorem*: Let $j: \cC(X, \bbR) \rar \bbR$ a positive linear continuous functional with $j(\bb1) = 1$, then $\exists \mu \in \cM(X)$ s.t. $j(\phi) = \int_X \phi \de \mu$.
    * *Proof*: Given $f$, we define an action on $\cM(X)$ given by $(f_* \mu)(A) = \mu(f^{-1}(A))$.
      Pick up an initial measure $\mu_0 \in \cM(X)$ and define $\mu_m = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j = 0}^{m - 1} f_*^j \mu_0$.
      By compactness there is a converging subsequence to an accumulation point $\nu \in \cM(X)$, that is invariant under $f_*$ and we have
      $$\int (\phi - \phi \circ f) \de \mu_n = \frac{1}{m} \abs{\int \sum_{j = 0}^{m - 1} (\phi \circ f^j - \phi \circ f^{j+1}) \de \mu} = \frac{1}{m} \lrt{\abs{\int \phi \de\mu} + \abs{\int \phi \circ f^{n+1} \de\mu}} \le \frac{2 \cdot \max_X \phi}{m} \rar_{m \rar \infty} 0$$
  - (*PoincarÃ© recurrence theorem*) $\mu(A_\text{rec}) = \mu(A)$.
  - (*Unique erogidicity is equivalent to uniform convergence of Birkoff averages*) Let $X$ be a compact metric space, $\cA = \Bor(X)$, $f \in \cC^0$ and let us assume that $\cM_f(X) = \lrg\mu$. Then
    1. $\mu$ is ergodic
    2. $\forall \phi \in \cC(X, \bbR)$ the Birkoff averages converges uniformly to $\bbE$, i.e. $\frac1n \sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} \phi \circ f^j \stackrel{\rar}{\rar} \int \phi \de\mu$.

    Also $(2) \implies $ unique ergodicity.
  
    /Lemmas/:
    1. $\mu \in \cM_f(X)$ is ergodic $\sse$ it is an extremal point of $\cM_f(X)$.
  - (*f-invariance, full support and ergodic => top transitivity*) If $\mu$ is $f$-invariant and has full support, $\mu$ ergodic $\implies$ that $X$ is top.transitive and moreover $\mu(\lrg{x \in X \mid \bar{\Orb_f(x)} = X}) = 1$.

    The converse is false: the counterexample is a time reparametrization of irrational linear flow $\phi$ on $\bbT^2$ which is top. transitive but the invariant probability measure is $M_{\phi_t} = \lrg{\delta_p}$.
    It is enough to have $\frac{\de t}{\de \tau} = \phi(x)$, i.e. slowing down the flux to let it have a fixpoint.

    But: *theorem*: If $f$ is uniquely ergodic and $\cM_f = \lrg\mu$ then $f$ is minimal iff $\mu$ has full support.
  - (*Gottschalk-Hedlund*) If $f$ is minimal and $\exists x_0 \in X$, $\exists C > 0$ s.t. $\forall n$ we have $\abs{\sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} \phi \circ f^j(x_0)} \le C$ then $\exists \psi$ s.t. $\phi = \psi \circ f - \psi$.
